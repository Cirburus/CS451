*******Personal Notes about installing WordNet MBP15 2011 with Yosemote 10.10********
To install WordNet I first needed to ensure that TCL/TK was installed. According to my research TCL comes stock on MacOSX but TK does not. I went to http://www.tcl.tk/ and found the installer for TK8.6, however this requires a matching version of TCL (8.6+) but the stock version is TCL8.5.x. So I went back to http://www.tcl.tk/ and downloaded tk8.5.x instead. This worked fine. I untar'ed the package and ./configured => Make, but it wanted me to have X11. X11 does not come stock on Yosemite any more and has since been crowdsourced by apple through Quartz. I attempted to run X11 through the normal graphic windows on MacOS and it took me to Quartz's homepage where I could download the current version of X11.
